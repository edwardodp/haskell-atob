# haskell-atob

An interpreter for the esoteric language [**A=B**](https://esolangs.org/wiki/A%3DB) (pronounced *"a to b"*), written entirely in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

---

## What is A=B?

A=B is a minimalist esoteric programming language that operates solely through **text replacement rules**. The program consists of a series of transformation instructions, and an **input string** is passed in at runtime. The instructions modify the string in a loop until no more transformations can be made.

### How it works

Each line of an A=B program contains:

```
string1=string2
```

- If `string1` exists in the current string, it is replaced by `string2`.
- If not, the program moves to the next line.
- When a rule is applied, the interpreter restarts from the top.
- The program halts only when **no rule** applies anymore.

---

## Special Syntax

A=B features several special keywords that add conditional behavior to replacement rules:

| Syntax                          | Meaning                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `(start)string1=string2`        | Match `string1` only at the **start** of the input string               |
| `(end)string1=string2`          | Match `string1` only at the **end** of the input string                 |
| `string1=(start)string2`        | Insert `string2` at **start** after removing `string1`                  |
| `string1=(end)string2`          | Insert `string2` at **end** after removing `string1`                    |
| `(start)string1=(end)string2`   | Match `string1` at start, delete it, append `string2` at end            |
| `string1=(return)string2`       | If `string1` is found, replace it with `string2` and **terminate**      |
| `(once)string1=string2`         | Instruction can only be executed **once** during entire execution       |

### Combination Rules

If the string ends in `abc`, remove it and add `xyz` to the front — but only once.
- You cannot combine `(start)`, `(end)`, or `(return)` as this makes no sense.
- You can only use `(once)` on the left-hand-side of the instruction.
- You can only use `(return)` on the right-hand-side of the instruction.
- `(once)` must come before `(start)`/`(end)` if used in combination.
  - A=B doesn't traditionally support combining `(once)` with another keyword on LHS; however, it makes sense to allow this functionality
### Combined Example

```
(once)(end)abc=(start)xyz
```

## Running the Interpreter

Make sure you have [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) installed.

### Using the `to` Wrapper Script (Recommended)
A simple Zsh wrapper script is provided to simplify running programs.

1.  **Make it Executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x to
    ```
2.  **Run a Program:**
    ```bash
    ./to programname inputstring
    ```

#### Example Use Case
To check if a string is a palindrome using the provided `palindrome.to` program:

```bash
%./to code/palindrome abcabc
false
```

### Using stack directly:
```bash
stack run -- programname inputstring
```

> Note: Omit the `.to` extension when passing `programname`.  
> Don't use quotation marks around the input string.  

### File Requirements:
- Program files must end with extension `.to`.
- Input and instruction strings must be:
  - no spaces
  - no reserved characters: `(` `)` `=` `#`
  - No empty input strings, but empty instruction strings are permitted (and useful!)

### Comments
Use `#` at the beginning or middle of a line for a comment. Only one instruction per line.

## Testing

Test cases are located in `test/cases/`. Each `.txt` file contains alternating lines:
```
input1
expected_output1
input2
expected_output2
...
```

The interpreter is tested using these pairs to ensure correctness.

To run tests:

```bash
stack test
```

You can also see the code solutions to these tests under `code/` (all of which primarily assume only "a", "b", and "c" are used to makeup input strings)
